LS.2 POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS BLOOD AND PRODUCTS 
Potentially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectious blood and blood components can 
come from a donor who: tested negative at the time of donation but tests reactive for evidence 
of HIV infection on a later donation; tests positive on the supplemental (additional, more 
specific) test or other follow-up testing required by FDA; and for whom the timing of 
seroconversion cannot be precisely estimated. Potentially hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious 
blood and blood components are the blood and blood components identified in 21 CFR 610.47.   
SR.1 If an organization regularly uses the services of an outside blood bank, it shall have an 
agreement with the blood bank that governs the procurement, transfer, and availability 
of blood and blood products. 
SR.2 The agreement shall require that the blood bank promptly notify the organization of the 
following: 
SR.2a Within three calendar days if the blood bank supplied blood and blood products 
collected from a donor who tested negative at the time of donation but tests 
repeatedly reactive for the antibody to HIV or HCV on a later donation; and, 
SR.2b The results of the FDA licensed more specific test or other follow-up testing 
recommended or required by the FDA completed within 45 calendar days after 
the donor’s repeatedly reactive screening test for HIV or HCV. 
SR.2c Within 3 calendar days after the blood bank supplied blood and blood 
components collected from an infectious donor, whenever such records are 
available.  
SR.2d Quarantine of blood and blood products pending completion of testing: If the 
blood bank notifies the organization of the repeatedly reactive HIV or HCV 
screening test results, the organization shall determine the disposition of the

blood or blood product and quarantine all blood and blood products from 
previous donations in inventory. 
SR.3 If the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more 
specific test or other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is negative, 
absent other informative test results, the organization may release the blood and blood 
products from quarantine. 
SR.4 If the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more 
specific test or other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is positive, the 
organization shall dispose of the blood and blood products and notify the transfusion 
recipients according to LS.3. 
SR.5 If the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more 
specific test or other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is 
indeterminate, the organization shall destroy or label prior collections of blood and 
blood products held in quarantine (as set forth at 21 CFR 610.46(b)(2) and 
610.47(b)(2)).  
SR.6 The organization shall maintain adequate records which identify the source and 
disposition of all units of blood and blood components for no less than 10 years from 
the date of disposition in manner reflecting QM.2 (SR.3b) and are stored in such a 
manner they are available for prompt retrieval. 
SR.6a The organization will have a plan in place to transfer these records to another 
hospital or other entity if the hospital ceases its operations for any reason. The 
organization will have allocated adequate funding to execute this plan when 
necessary. 
Interpretive Guidelines: 
This standard requires that the hospital have a system in place to take appropriate action when 
notified that blood or blood products received are at increased risk of transmitting potential 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). 
Definition: The timeframe, also referred to as the “window period”, is defined as that period early 
in infection when the antibody to HIV or HCV is not detectable by the screening test. 
Definition: The term “repeatedly reactive” means that the initial HIV or HCV antibody screening 
test is reactive, retested in duplicate, and one or both of the duplicate tests are reactive. If 
repeatedly reactive, a licensed, more specific (confirmatory) test (e.g., Western Blot) is used to 
confirm the presence of HIV or HCV. 
Definition: “Look back” is considered to include: the quarantine of products from a window 
period donor; notification of consignees (facilities having received such window period products) 
to quarantine those products; and on completion of the licensed, more specific (confirmatory) 
test, notification of any transfusion recipient. 
Despite the best practices of blood banks, a person may have donated blood during the window

Revision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025 
Page 112 of 458 
 
The medical staff or pharmaceutical oversight group shall select a list of medications (formulary) 
to be available within the organization. The list shall be available to all appropriate staff at all 
times. 
The formulary lists medications for dispensing or administration that the organization maintains 
or that are readily available. In accordance with accepted nationally recognized standards of 
practice and guidelines, the medical staff, in consultation with the pharmacy service, should 
develop written criteria for determining what medications are available for dispensing or 
administration. At a minimum, the criteria include the indication for use, effectiveness, risks 
(including propensity for medication errors, abuse potential, and adverse events), and costs. 
The formulary may be maintained either electronically on the organization’s information 
management system or in a hardcopy form. The organization will ensure a means of notifying 
the hospital staff and medical staff when changes are made to the formulary. 
The organization will have a process in place that addresses medication-related issues to 
include: 
• Communicating with appropriate prescribers and staff; 
• Developing approved substitution protocols; and 
• Educating appropriate LPs, appropriate health care professionals, and staff about 
these protocols; and obtaining medications in the event of a disaster. 
The organization will have a policy and procedure in place to address the process for requests 
for medications to be added to the formulary before the medications are available for dispensing 
and administration and that the medical staff oversees this process. 
The organization should have processes to approve and procure medications that are not on 
the hospital’s formulary. 
Surveyor Guidance: 
Verify that the pharmacy has an established formulary of medications that are available in the 
hospital. Verify that there is a process for creation and periodic review of a formulary system. 
Validate the policy and procedure in place to address the process for requests for medications 
to be added to the formulary before the medications are available for dispensing and 
administration. 
Verify the organization has a process to approve and procure medications that are not on the 
hospital’s formulary.
